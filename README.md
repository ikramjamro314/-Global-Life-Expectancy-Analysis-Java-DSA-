ðŸš€ Passionate Data Science & Algorithm Enthusiast | Java Learner                                                                    
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, everyone! I'm excited to share a project I recently completed! In my third semester, I tackled Data Structures and Algorithms, a challenging subject in all my Software Engineering careers. While it was tough at first, I persevered and gained a strong foundation in these essential concepts.
To put my newfound skills to the test our instructor gave us a Java program that analyzes a real-world dataset on Global Life Expectancy (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who). Here's what it does:                                 
ðŸ“Š In my latest project, I dive into the realm of data science and algorithms by creating robust data structures and implementing algorithms to manipulate real-world data. Utilizing the Global Life Expectancy Historical Dataset from Kaggle, I crafted algorithms to extract insights and perform operations on this invaluable dataset. I Creates Data Structures to store the data including Hash tables, Queues, Stacks, arrays, and Array lists. I perform many operations on these data structures to manipulate the data. 
This gives me a deep view of how the data structure works on real-life data. I just love these concepts and feel proud to manipulate data of about 12,710â€™ with some taps.                                                                                    
Feel free to contribute to this GitHub repository, I am eager to connect with the Java developers. Let's collaborate and explore the endless possibilities at the intersection of data science and algorithmic programming!
